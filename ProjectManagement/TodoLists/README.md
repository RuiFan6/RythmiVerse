# WEEK 3

TODO (Last updated 13.3)

Networking:
Storing the sequence in a list - A/T

Passing the sequence to other player A/T

Implement voice chat A/T

When drumsticks move and collisions happen the other person sees this in real time A/T

Drum model:
Fix positioning of drums for better ux  Jiaming

Scale drum/stick size to fit Jiaming

Have only one drum kit Jiaming

When drum is hit, light up the exact point of collision Jiaming



Avatars:
Appearence Dennis

Hands Jiaming

Teleporting behind the back to a side of the other when not playing A/T

Fix position of avatars at all times Jiaming

Scene:
Make objects in the scene persistent A/T

Scoring system:
Takes in accuracy of each hit, range for precision, 
visualised as a letter grade after sequence finishes J/D

Message passing:
Sequence of drum hits recorded and stored (collisions and timesteps) A/T

Collisions:
Fix collisions to prevent double hitting, set a flag when inside object, collision does not trigger inside Jiaming

Haptic feedback / vibration after hit Jiaaming

Aesthetic
Countdown after pressing finish sequence button (at the start of playing to give time to prep) Dennis

Start menu to select role, when a role is taken, button becomes transparent and unclickable Dennis

Button on top of screen (in space above drum kit) which takes you back to start menu and deassigns your role Dennis

Menu to retry sequence after finishing or go onto role switch and next sequence Dennis

Drum lights up from the rim inwards as the correct timing of a hit approaches Jiaming A/T

Red record dot flashes on screen while teacher records sequence Dennis

Button press to start sequence (for both roles) and button press to finish sequence(both) Dennis

Scene:
Add a bit more objects inside (Piano?) Dennis


Optional
Setting a metronome to aid tempo following visible on the screen as a number and making a beeping sound in intervals Jiaming
